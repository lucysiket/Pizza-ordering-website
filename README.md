# Pizza ordering website

This is the main project I completed during my work experience placement at Borwell.

It is a pizza ordering website (inspired by Dominoes) that I developed in order to experiment
with the C# Blazor framework. This program also utilises SQL databases to store information
about the pizzas available to order.
